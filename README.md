- 👋 Hi, My name is Gerald Bartlett (Full Stack Developer). I recently graduated the Software Development program at Keyin College, St.Johns NL 
- 🌱 Languages Studied: Python, JavaScript & Java. Web Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Web API (Rest), React Js, Node Js, Node ejs, UI/UX Design using Figma, Lucid Chart & Safe Agile using Trello Boards. Content Management using GitHub. Software Testing using J Unit. Database programming using PostgreSQL, Mongo db & MySql. Development tools such as Postman & Docker. I am passionate and focused when I take on any task. I am eager to learn, work well within a team and love eureka moments when coding. I recently purchased the Java Development Boot Camp program from Udemy to keep up on my java skills. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects using the language skills I have obtained within my studies as well as working with databases.
- My favorite part of coding is while working on a project within a team and you are all stuck on some code and after awhile of reading what you have (as well as using Google really well lol) then that "Eureka Moment" happens and it all starts to come together, what a euphoric moment!
-  Just an example, while working on a class project we had to initiate log events on the searches within the program, but we could'nt figure out why we would get incrementing log events when we only wanted 1 log event per search, then after a little research we figured it was the code this.emmiter.on needed to be this.emitter.once wow! just a simple change and bam code working great... Love that eurphoria!!!
