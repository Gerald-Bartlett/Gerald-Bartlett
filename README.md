- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gerald-Bartlett
- 👀 I am studying Software Development. I currently finished my 3rd semester of a 4 semester Software Development program @ Keyin College 
- 🌱 I have studied Python, HTML, Css, UI/UX Design using Figma, JavaScript, React Js, Node Js, Node ejs, Database programming using PostgreSQL and Mongo Db, AWS Cloud Practitioner & AWS Cloud Developing. 
- Looking forward to starting Java in semester 4.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development using HTML, CSS, javaScript, or React Js as well as working with databases using PostgreSQL. I am currently studying         Mongo DB
- My favorite part of coding is when working on a project with a team and you are all stuck and after awhile of reading what you have then the "Eureka Moment" happens and it all starts to come together , what a euphoric moment!
